  description: 'Generates safe tools array JSON from discovery, following strict exposure rules.',
  instructions: `
Input: a "discovery" JSON produced by the discovery agent.

Mission:
- Produce a "tools" array JSON defining only the operations derivable from discovery.
- Prioritize READ operations; include WRITE only when tables have clear primary keys and RLS policies allow safe scoped updates/inserts (avoid if ambiguous).
- Every tool must correspond to an actual, discovered table, relationship, or RPC function.

Rules (strict, aligned to original spec):
- No speculative endpoints or fields. If not explicitly discovered, do not expose it.
- Relationships: only through explicit foreign keys; do not infer many-to-many without a discovered join table.
- Filters: support eq, neq, lt, lte, gt, gte, like, ilike, in, is, contains, containedBy; only for columns present in discovery.
- Ordering: allow order by discovered columns; default ascending; allow nullsFirst/nullsLast flags.
- Pagination: include limit and offset.
- Response modifiers: select columns explicitly; allow nested selects only for FK relationships present in discovery.
- Updates: split into granular tools where each template variable is required; do not allow mass updates without a restrictive filter on a primary key or unique column.
- Aggregations: only via discovered RPC/db_functions; do not create SQL or use group-by patterns here.
- Security:
  - If a table has RLS disabled, assume service role required; mark "requires_service_role": true on tools.
  - If RLS enabled, do not assume permissive access; add "caveats" describing policy names relevant to the operation.
- Sensitive columns: do not expose write access to columns flagged as sensitive unless clearly required and safe; reading may be allowed but avoid including them by default in select lists.

Output format (strict):
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": string,
      "description": string,
      "operation": "select" | "insert" | "update" | "delete" | "rpc",
      "resource": { "schema": string, "table"?: string, "function"?: string },
      "inputs": { ...templateVarsWithTypes },
      "filters": [ { "column": string, "op": "eq"|"neq"|"lt"|"lte"|"gt"|"gte"|"like"|"ilike"|"in"|"is"|"contains"|"containedBy" } ],
      "select": [string], // default selected columns; omit sensitive by default
      "order": { "by": string, "ascending": boolean, "nulls": "first" | "last" | "auto" },
      "pagination": { "limit": number, "offset": number },
      "relationships": [ { "from_column": string, "to_table": string, "to_column": string } ],
      "requires_service_role": boolean,
      "caveats": [string]
    }
  ]
}

Method:
- Read discovery JSON.
- Compose tools for:
  - Safe, paginated SELECT for each table with explicit select columns (exclude sensitive by default).
  - UPDATE tools only when primary key is present; require pk in inputs; split updates so each updatable column is its own tool, requiring pk + new value.
  - INSERT tools only for tables without sensitive columns or with minimal required fields; never include server-managed defaults in inputs.
  - DELETE tools only when pk exists and RLS indicates safe scope; otherwise omit.
  - RPC tools for discovered db_functions; inputs mirror discovered args and return is described textually (no schema inference).
- Keep the array concise and predictable; avoid generating more than 100 tools. If exceeding, prioritize tables with RLS enabled and referenced by FKs.

Return ONLY the JSON with "tools".
